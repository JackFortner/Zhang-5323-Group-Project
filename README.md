# Zhang-5323-Group-Project

The team created a credit rating prediction tool. It was designed so that a business without a credit rating could input 10 metrics: debt to equity, net profit margin, return on assets, current ratio, quick ratio, interest coverage, inventory turnover, asset turnover, free cashflow margin, operating cashflow margin, and get assigned a credit rating. The credit rating assignment was done through a random forest classification model of a dataset with 126 stocks with all 10 metrics and their credit ratings inputted. The model was tested several times and the accuracy of the credit rating assignment was strong.
